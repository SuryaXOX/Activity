Last year, my friends and I went to a roller coaster theme park known as the Ferrari World, Abu Dhabi.
It was a bright and sunny day as you would expect it to be in the Middle East.
Abu Dhabi is Dubai’s closest city. It’s like a one hour drive from Dubai. 
If you’re not familiar with the Ferrari World,well..,
It is home to the world’s fastest roller coaster ride, THE FORMULA ROSSA. It hits 240 km/hr in less than 10 seconds and then shoots up a ramp 100m high and then drops down within a blink of an eye.
