Last year, my friends and I went to a roller coaster theme park known as the Ferrari World, Abu Dhabi.
It was a bright and sunny day as you would expect it to be in the Middle East.
Abu Dhabi is Dubai’s closest city. It’s like a one hour drive from Dubai. 
If you’re not familiar with the Ferrari World,well..,
It is home to the world’s fastest roller coaster ride, THE FORMULA ROSSA. It hits 240 km/hr in less than 10 seconds and then shoots up a ramp 100m high and then drops down within a blink of an eye.

When we got on the roller coaster, my friends and I all held hands because we were so scared.
The ride attendant said 3 2 1 and then blast off.
The ride launched itself into thin air faster than our screams could leave our breath

The speed was blisteringly fast, and before the gasps left our throats we were at the top of the peak.
Then, in an instant, we were racing back down, veering left and right, right and left, through loops and bumps, until as suddenly as it had started, it was over.
The Formula Rossa lived up to our expectations tenfold.  It was a wonderful day in Ferrari World.
